# Detect SSH failed attempts
Curious to know who is trying to get into your server via SSH?

Log in your Linux server, run this command in your terminal or clone this repository and execute the python file.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/philipperemy/ssh-failed-attempts/master/ssh.py && clear && python3 ssh.py
```

If your server receives a lot of attacks, you might consider to ban those IPs automatically. More info [fail2ban](https://www.linode.com/docs/security/using-fail2ban-to-secure-your-server-a-tutorial/).

Here is an example of output:

More output can be generated by specifying the number of lines to display `n`:

```
python3.6 ssh.py n # default n = 20 lines.
```
